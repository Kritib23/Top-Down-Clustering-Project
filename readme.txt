The code is written in Jupyter Notebook.

In order to run the Jupyter Notebook file, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    pip install jupyter notebook


Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can open the notebook file by navigating to the directory where the file is saved in your terminal or command prompt, and then running the following command:

    jupyter notebook 20CS30028_PLHC-DC.ipynb
    
    
If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer or if you want to run the notebook file in a cloud-based environment, you can use Google Colab to run the file. Here's how:

    Open your web browser and go to the Google Colab website.
    Click on the "File" menu and select "Upload Notebook".
    Select the .ipynb file you want to upload from your computer.
    The notebook file will now open in Google Colab, and you can run the notebook as usual.
